Enhancing customer experience and operational efficiency in the airline industry hinges on optimizing the check-in process and boarding pass issuance, and AeroCheck is a cutting-edge software designed to achieve just that. This paper details the creation of AeroCheck, a system that simplifies check-ins through self-service kiosks and specialized counters, seamlessly integrates with airport security for efficient baggage screening, and provides robust support for travelers with special needs. The system, developed using object-oriented programming in C++, is meticulously architected with a comprehensive class diagram that justifies each class's properties and methods. By automating these critical touchpoints, AeroCheck not only maximizes resource efficiency for airlines but also enhances the overall travel experience. The paper concludes with a discussion on the potential impact of AeroCheck on the aviation industry.
